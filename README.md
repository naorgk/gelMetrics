Code To accompany the paper:
GelMetrics: An algorithm for analyzing the dynamics of gel-like phase separated condensates


This repository contains all the code and data required to recreate the figures from the paper.
To run on simulated data run the script: SimulationRunWithAnalysis.m
You can switch between simulation types using the simType variable defined within the script.

To run on experimental data run the script: ExperimentalAnalysis.m
You can switch between different data sets by un/commenting the relevant signals and backgrounds variables which load the signal files

Tested on Matlab 2021b
